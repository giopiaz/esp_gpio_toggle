This is a remake of Rui Santos' ESP8266 webserver found here: http://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-web-server/ and here: https://youtu.be/ONKM5lSthNY. It's functional identical to Rui's code, the only difference is that rather than the HTML code being embedded in the Lua code, it's in a separate INDEX.HTML file, this allows the user to easily modify the appearance of the page without having to alter the Lua code. The INDEX.HTML file uploaded here make extensive use to CSS to style the page. 

It's early days in this project, the next step is to experiment with javascript and AJAX to add even more functionality.
