This is a remake of Rui Santos' ESP8266 webserver found at http://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-web-server/
the main difference between this and Rui's version is that rather than the HTML code being embedded in the Lua code, it's in a separate INDEX.HTML file, this allows the user to easily modify the appearance of the page without having to alter the Lua code.
